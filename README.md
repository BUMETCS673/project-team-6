## Team Rocket: RCM - Rental Car Management
The purpose of RCM is to be a business management tool specifically for car rental companies. 
It should be used by the company to manage inventory, maintenance schedules, and edit information 
to each car as needed. In addition, the tool will have a database that will contain all of this 
information that will be easy to search for by various parameters.
In the case of searching for vehicles, you will be able to search via:
1. The vehicle ID
2. The vehicle manufactorer
3. The vehicle model
4. The vehicle type

As for the maintenance side, it will show which vehicles need maintenance, and if you wish to inspect
and individual vehicle you can see all of its past and scheduled maintenances.

We also wish to include security features, so that you much login to access the data, and that you only
access data to which belong to you.
